## Overview

This project focuses on image segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of the clustering, the Silhouette Score is used. The Silhouette Score measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. Higher scores indicate better-defined clusters.

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
